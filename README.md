## Description

This project is a Etch-a-Sketch, it has different grid types. It only draws in one color, it is a pretty simple project. 
If you aren‚Äôt familiar with what a Etch-a-Sketch, I recommend you reading about it on [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch).
This project was part of the [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://theodinproject.com/about).

## What did I learn?

From this project I learnt more about using variables in DOM Manipulation, the scope of things, mostly about `addEventListener`‚Äôs and events. This was a great project and I definitely noticed growth and improvement in my JavaScript skills.

## Technologies

For this project I only used three technologies:
1. JavaScript, I used JavaScript the most as that was the assignment.
2. CSS, I obviously needed to style the page to give it some spice.
3. HTML, the page needed some structure and it needs to link the script and stylesheet.

## Roadmap

**Required**
1. [x] Create Grid
2. [x] Add functional grid buttons
3. [x] Add the ability to draw
4. [x] Style the page, and make it sort of responsive.

**Extras**
5. [ ] Add mobile support (I‚Äôll add this in the near future)
6. [ ] Add a color picker
7. [ ] Add a rainbow mode
